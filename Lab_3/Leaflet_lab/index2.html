              In American politics, the term :swing state" refers to any state that could reasonably be won by either the Democratic or Republican presidential candidate. These states are usually targeted by both major-party campaigns, especially in competitive elections. Florida is considered a swing state. In the 2018 Midterm Elections, 2 Congressional districts (26 and 27) were previously held by Republican representatives but turned "blue" and voted in Democratic representatives.<br>
               <font color="red">Red </font>boundary lines are Congressional districts<br>
              <font color="blue">Blue</font> boundary lines are Senate districts<p>
